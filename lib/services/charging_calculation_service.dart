class ChargingCalculationService {
  // 1 FUNCTION TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED CHARGING TIME

  // Add your class implementation here
  // CHECK IF USER HAD SETUP A VEHICLE
  // IF NOT SHOW HIM WINDOW WHERE HE CAN CLICK TO ADD VEHICLE
  // from loaded station data and vehicle data calculate the estimated charging time

  // 2 FUNCTION TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED BATERY CONSUMPTION FROM A PLANNED TRIP
  //CHECK IF USER HAD SETUP A VEHICLE
  // IF NOT SHOW HIM WINDOW WHERE HE CAN CLICK TO ADD VEHICLE
  // from chosen route data and vehicle data calculate the estimated batery consumption
  // calculation should consint of the following steps:
  // 1. Calculate the distance of the trip
  // 2. Calculate the elevation of the trip
  // 3. Calculate the average speed of the trip
  // 4. Calculate the average energy consumption of the trip
  // 5. Calculate the estimated batery consumption of the trip
  // 6. Calculate the estimated charging time of the trip (users could also maybe like the trip duration to be calculated with charging stops)
